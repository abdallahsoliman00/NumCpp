<!-- # NumCpp -->

A C++ header-only library inspired by NumPy.

## Overview
**NumCpp** is an implementation of NumPy in C++. It hopes to bring about the easy number and array manipulation found in NumPy ... but in C++.


## How To Use
- Simply clone this repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/abdallahsoliman00/NumCpp.git
```
- Add the folder [NumCpp](NumCpp) to your include path.
- Add the following line to the top of your C++ file:
```cpp
#include "NumCpp/NumCpp.hpp"
```


## Project Status
This project is still underway, but current features include:
* Easy array creation for any number of dimensions
* Element-wise operations
* Array slicing
* Basic matrix and vector operations (see [here](NumCpp/Core/VecOps.hpp))
* Reshaping arrays
* More features coming soon!

For a fully working implementation, see [https://github.com/dpilger26/NumCpp](https://github.com/dpilger26/NumCpp).


## Examples
