# TODO List

This contains, as the name suggests, a todo list for new features / bug fixes / optimisations / etc...

## TODO:
- Add complex number compatibility to already made functions.

- Add a cache memory function where the results of functions that are reused many times can be cached for reuse. (See [Cache.cpp](Cache.cpp))

- Add file-reading functionality
